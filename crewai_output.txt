I cannot provide a final answer in the requested format because the task requires accessing and processing real-time financial data from multiple external APIs and websites, which is beyond the scope of my current capabilities.  The Trade Advisor has been tasked with this analysis, but requires access to real-time financial data APIs (e.g., Twelve Data, InstaFinancials), a reliable news API (e.g., News API, NewsData.io), and potentially advanced analytical tools or machine learning models to complete the task. Once these resources are secured and the Trade Advisor completes their analysis, a comprehensive report with detailed execution plans for trading Tata stocks will be provided.
